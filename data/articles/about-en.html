    <h2>INTRODUCTION<sup>
            <a href="#n1">1</a>
        </sup>
    </h2>

    <p>Ancient Greek personal names, or anthroponyms, have been the object of intensive research
        activity, since there began at Oxford in the 70s, under the direction of Peter Fraser and
        Elaine Matthews, the preparation of a repertory of the persons bearing these names,
        geographically organised: the <i>Lexicon of Greek Personal Names</i> (<b>LGPN</b>). Seven
        volumes have appeared to date, recording under their names all the persons known from
        inscribed documents in the Greek mainland, the Greek islands, Asia Minor and up to the
        limits of the Greek world. 350,000 individuals have been identified to date, bearing a total
        of 35,000 different names of which not all are certainly Greek.</p>

    <p>In this context, our project <i>LGPN-Ling, Linguistic analysis of ancient Greek personal
            names: electronic and printed dictionary</i> is twofold: <br/> 1. to provide the missing
        etymological and semantic enrichment to the <a href="http://www.lgpn.ox.ac.uk/online/index.html">
            <i>Database Search</i>
        </a>, which is
        currently being re-designed to permit such an extension. <br/> 2. to extract from it a
        printed dictionary, intended to replace the outdated work of Friedrich Bechtel <i>Die
            Historischen Personennamen des griechischen bis zur Kaiserzeit</i> (1917, hereafter
            <b>HPN</b>).</p>

    <p>The aim is to provide an elucidation of the meaning of Greek names, a task which has never
        before been undertaken except in sporadic fashion and without argument in the outdated work
        of W. Pape-G. E. Benseler, <i>Wörterbuch der griechischen Eigennamen</i> (1870), and for the
        names known from papyri, in the database <a href="http://www.trismegistos.org/nam/search.php">
            <i>Trismegistos</i>
        </a>. In the
        project that we present, justifications of proposed meanings will be given, drawn from the
        various sources available to us: literature, grammarians, epigraphic and papyrological. </p>

    <h3>FOREWORD</h3>

    <p>
        <b>a. Selection criteria.</b> In view of the size of the corpus, and following the example
        of Bechtel, analysis has been restricted to one form only of any name, whether compound or
        simple, - more precisely either the earliest attested form and/or, regarding a dialectal
        form, the most typical . This principle applies in particular to all radicals and suffixes
        ending in /a:/ - the latter being recorded as α or η according to the dialect or the
        historical period. Accordingly, there is only one entry for Dēmonikos/ Δηµόνικος and
        Dāmonikos/Δᾱµόνικος, for Alexidas/Ἀλεξίδᾱς and Alexidēs/Ἀλεξίδης and likewise for pairs such
        as Habryllos/Ἅβρυλλος vs Habrylla/Ἅβρυλλα masc. -ος vs fem. -ᾱ/η. Iotacism has been taken
        into account if it serves as a dialect marker, as for e.g. Boeot. Agathoklidas/Ἀγαθοκλίδας
        (fifth cent.)., vs Dor. Agathokleidas/ Ἀγαθοκλείδας (hellenistic).</p>

    <p>
        <b>b. Translation.</b> Only occasionally have been names translated: most of the time we
        remain at the level of elements of meaning, since the focus is on the name - viewed as an
        abstract entity - rather than on any of its occurrences. In fact, the extent of their use in
        space and time is likely to have brought about notable variations in terms of meaning or
        connotation, and sometimes also from one dialect to another. </p>

    <p>
        <b>c. Typology of compounds.</b> Given the overrepresentation of Hellenistic and imperial
        material, the classification system adopted for compounds has been mainly synchronic
        (headedness, X label) rather than resting on inherited syntactic categories (possessives,
        hypostatics, verbal rection, determinatives).<sup>
            <a href="#n2">2</a>
        </sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>d. Systematic treatment of anthroponymic onomastics</b> viewed as a lexicon personae is a
        highly sensitive matter because this field has been even more creative than the lexicon at
        large, especially regarding name compounding and derivation of abbreviated compounds and
        simplicia. The labelling of structures reshaped by analogical renovations within particular
        series of compounds is even more difficult. For instance, compounds whose second element is
        a verbal adjective in -τος - these have probably been coined on the analogy of some reverse
        structure having a first verbal element in –σι such as Lysippos/Λύσ-ιππος vs
        Hippolytos/Ἱππό-λυτος, whence YX&lt;XY, see 8 and n. 5 below<sup>
            <a href="#n3">3</a>
        </sup>.
        The same holds true for names such as archaic Aeol. Abanthis/Ἀβανθίς (&lt;*αυσ-ανθ-, with
        οὖς ‛ear’ &lt;*aus<sup>
            <a href="#n4">4</a>
        </sup> and ἄνθος ‘flower’), wich are all the more opaque for us as they remain
        isolated. </p>

    <h3>The name and its context </h3>

    <p>
        <b>1*.</b> Name transliterated in Latin alphabet. <br/>
        <b>2*.</b> Name written in Greek alphabet, spelt as it was in the source – this will later
        form a <b>link to its bearer(s)</b> in the LGPN database. <br/>
        <b>3*.</b> Number of occurrences (data extracted automatically from the LGPN database). <br/>
        <b>4*.</b> Gender: masculine, feminine or both (extracted). <br/>
        <b>5*.</b> Dialectal labelling (including <i>koinai</i> or bilingual forms). Dialectal
        labels apply to names in usage in specific geographic or dialectal areas, either because
        they exhibit dialectal or more broadly speaking areal traits or because they depend on the
        circumstantial distribution of their occurrences, in contrast to pandialectal forms.
        Bilingual labels deal with bilingual names, reminiscent of contacts between Greek and other
        languages. <br/>
        <b>6*.</b> Chronological range of occurrences (extracted). </p>

    <h3>Linguistic analysis</h3>

    <p>
        <b>7. Segmentation</b>
        <br/>
        <b>7.1. Prefixes*</b>: adverbial first elements as negative α(ν)/ν-, copulative (h)α-,
        αµφ(ι), αν(α), αντ(ι)- etc. and rare nominal first elements as θε(ο)- in the few trithematic
        compounds, as Εὐ- αρχί-δαµος or Θευ-δ-αγόρας. <br/>
        <b>7.2. Bases 1* and 2*</b>(including Roots <i>stricto sensu</i>). Each of these lexical
        morphems is given in the most generic form possible, hence the option to omit the linking
        vowel at the end, as for ᾱ̆γ, αρχ, and to note ᾱ the /a:/ vowel whose sounding evolved into
        /ε:/ in Ionian Attic and later koine and came to be written as η. Segmentation by hyphens
        has been guided by etymology whenever possible, with a view to separate the root stricto
        sensu from the derivational affixes and suffixes it may include, viz. these very elements
        that would change a Root into a Base (αγαλ-µα[τ]). Brackets are intended to isolate variable
        elements at the following positions: a) at the initial or medial position of the base (vowel
        alternation, consonants apt to vary, be absent or mute according to dialect or chronology);
        b) at the junction between base and anthroponymic suffix (concerning elidable vowels
        belonging to the radical or to the suffix, and other segments). <br/>
        <b>7.3. Suffixes numbered 4*, 3*, 2* et 1*</b>: <i>stricto sensu</i>. These do <b>not</b>
        belong to the base of the lexeme underlying the personal name under study (for instance µεν-
        in ἀγαλ(λ)-ό- µεν-, base of Agallomenē/Ἀγαλλοµεν-ή coined on participle ἀγαλλόµενος, -η,
        -ον), <b>but</b> they are parts of the very name – in the example above only the flexional
        suffix -ή). They have been arranged from left to right in the tables, that is, in the
        reverse order of their frequency and importance: the flexional suffix or head of the
        suffixal chain thus ranks 1, whereas rank 4 is hardly ever occupied (see
            Philonichidēs/Φιλ<sub>R</sub>-ων<sub>S4</sub>-ιχ<sub>S3</sub>-ίδ<sub>S2</sub>-ης<sub>S1</sub>). </p>

    <p>
        <b>8. Name structure: Functional and syntactic-semantic analysis</b>
        <br/>
        <b>8.1.</b>
        <i>Functional labels</i>: V*(erb) N*(ame) Adj*(ective) Pro*(noun) Adv*(erb), in decreasing
        order of importance<sup>
            <a href="#n5">5</a>
        </sup>. These labels point to the function of the root(s) or base(s) within
        the name, such a function itself mirroring the grammatical categories each of them may have
        developed in the lexicon, in particular through suffixal derivation. <br/>
        <b>8.1.1.</b>
        <i>Double labelling</i> of a base within a compound: <br/>
        <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
            <b>V N*</b> = action noun, agent nouns: e.g. ᾱ̆γορ- in Pnyt-agoras/Πνυτ-αγόρας ‘he who
            pronounces wise words in public’. <br/>
            <b>V Adj*</b> = verbal adjective<sup>
                <a href="#n6">6</a>
            </sup> , participle: κρι-τ- in Abaiokritos/Ἀβαιό-κριτος
            ‘chosen by (Apollo) Abaios’. <br/>
            <b>N Adj*</b> = noun adjective: τελ- in Habrotelēs/Ἁβροτέλης ‘he who splendidly
            accomplishes’ or ‘splendidly accomplished’. <br/>
            <b>Adj Adv*</b> = adverbialized adjective: µεγ(α)- in Meg-ainetos/Μεγ-αίνετος ‘highly
            praised, worthy of high praise’. <br/>
            <b>V Adv*</b> = adverbialized verb: ἀρχ- in Archi-anassa/Ἀρχι-άνασσα ‘Archqueen’, see
            archiereus/ἀρχιερεύς ‘archpriest’ vs. Arche-laos/Ἀρχέ-λαος ‘the first (or the chief of)
            the men-at-arms’, wherein ἀρχ- functions like a V. </div>
        <b>8.1.2.</b>
        <i>Labelling of abbreviated compounds and simplicia</i>. Suffixation, being notably
        developed in the case of such monothematic personal names, has led to endeavour – in this
        particular case only, this does not hold for compounds – to label the root's or base's
        function adding to it a suffixal categorization, to the extent that the latter is clearly
        identifiable. Thus, we have: <br/>
        <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
            <b>-N</b> = any name whose root is a noun provided with an exclusive noun suffix in the
            lexicon, in particular if this name is a homonym of a lexical item such as Boeotian
            Kapos/Κᾶπος (Ion.- Att. κῆπος ‘garden’) or a derivative belonging to another proper name
            category (theonym, toponym and so forth), e.g. Athēnô/Ἀθηνώ. <br/>
            <b>-Adj</b> = an exact homonym of a lexical adjective or any anthroponym consisting of
            an adjectival root provided with an exclusive adjectival suffix in the lexicon (e. g.
            -ικός, -(V)ιος, fém. -(ϝ)έσσα, comparatives in -(ί)ων, -τερος) and/or that may be
            considered as adjectival in anthroponyms (-ίδᾱ/ης, hence -ιδεύς, -(ι)άδᾱ/ης, -ινάδᾱ/ης,

            on, the adverbalization of ἀρχ(ι), now endowed with a superlative sense close to ἀρι-,

        in principle also occupying the head position, see HPN 26, unless it is conjectured that the
        name came to be reinterpreted as ‘the liberation about which it is spoken, that has had so
        much impact‘, the first element now being related to the action noun λύσις: in this guise it
        might represent a feminine derivative of the father’s nickname or of an ancestor who
        liberated the city. </p>
    <p>
        <b>9. Meanings of radicals or bases</b>
        <br/> As mentioned above under Overview, the name is difficult to translate if viewed as an
        abstract entity. As a consequence, we chose to suggest one to three meanings for each
        radical, these meanings corresponding on the whole to lemmata entered in the etymological
        dictionaries DELG and EDG, see 10. In principle, the three meanings have been arranged from
        the most generic down to the most specific. If the radical appears in the lexicon as verbal
        form(s) or noun(s) and have these same values in the anthroponym, the three meanings are
        intended to cover them all. Thus, αρχ ‘(be) first, leader, magistracy’; αγορ ‘(speak in)
        assembly, speech’ bring together the values of noun ἀγορά and denominative verb ἀγορεύω ;
        αιθ ‘light up, blaze, (colour of) fire’ gathers two verbal diatheses and two nominal
        meanings, the former more generic and the latter more specific. The brakets allow to collect
        two meanings under a single sense. </p>

        <b>Abaio-krit-os/Ἀβαιό-κριτ-ος</b>, N Adj-V Adj (YX) ‘Abaios (Apollo) - choice, chosen’:
        Abai- is the radical of an epiclesis of Apollo, hence N Adj and the radical of the 2nd
        element is verbal adj. with passive sense, of verb κρίνω, hence V Adj. The latter is the
        head X of this syntagm, hence a YX structure. This reading sense favours the sense ‘chosen
        by/choice of (Apollo) Abaios’. <br/>
        <b>Ab-anthis/Ἀβ-ανθίς</b> N-N (XY/YX) ‘ear-flower, bloom, blooming’: in this case analysis
        may hesitate beween a recting nominal syntagm (YX ‘ear flower’ or ‘earring’) and a nominal
        predicate (ear flower or flower-shaped ear XY). The possibiltiy of double reading is summed
        up by XY/YX. <br/>
        <b>Archi-anax/Ἀρχι-άναξ</b>, VAdv-N (XY&gt;YX) ‘(be) first, leader, magistracy’-‘(be) lord,
        protect’: Archwas originally V and the second-element radical was N. Head X is expected to
        be the verb, hence XY, but Arch- may also have been employed as an Adv modifying N, hence
        XY&gt;YX and a shift of meanings from ‘leading lords’ to ‘arch-lord’. </p>

        <b>10. Correlated lexicon</b>
        <br/> This section provides: <br/>
        <b>10.1.</b> Any lexical and at times anthroponymic parallel — including Mycenaean —
        featuring in Greek dictionaries (Liddell-Scott-Jones,<i> Diccionario Griego-Español</i>,
            <i>Diccionario micénico</i>, Logeion* [links online]), whether literary (TLG Irvine) or
        indexed in the epigraphy databases of Packard Humanities Institute (PHI), <i>Supplementum
            Epigraphicum Graecum</i> (SEG) and http://papyri.info/search. <br/> 10.2. Shorts
        passages from literay authors, glosses or inscriptions are referred to inasmuch they give
        insight in the meaning of the corresponding lexeme, sometimes of the very name under study.
        This applies in particular to compounds whose sense, in the absence of a lexical
        correspondent, often stems from phraseological analysis or from the collocation of their
        elements within a nominal syntagm or a proposition. <br/> 10.3. Systematic reference to the
        lemmata* of <i>Dictionnaire étymologique de la langue grecque</i> (DELG 2, 2009) by P.
        Chantraine, completed with the fascicules of <i>Chronique d'étymologie grecque</i> (A.
        Blanc, Ch. de Lamberterie and J.-L. Perpillou eds. since 1996) [online release is being
        contemplated] and, if necessary to the Etymological Dictionary of Greek by R. S. P. Beekes
        (2010). Contemporary studies are mentioned to the extent that they provide new insight in
        etymology or word history. </p>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>
        <p>
            <a name="n1"/>1. Thanks to J.-C. Chuat (EPHE) for the translation, and to L. Dubois
            (EPHE), G. Genevrois (EPHE) and Cl. Le Feuvre (Paris-Sorbonne) for discussions about the
            text. </p>
        <p>
            <a name="n2"/>2. For these categories more suited to second-millennium and Homeric Greek
            , see J.L. Garcia Ramon ‘Mycenaen Onomastics’ in Y. Duhoux-A. Morpurgo Davies (eds), A
            Companion to Linear B. Mycenaean Greek Texts and their World, vol. 2, 2011, p. 221-222.
            For the previous categories, see note 6. </p>
        <p>
            <a name="n3"/>3. See also ibid., p. 224, on the flexibility of the internal syntax of
            compounds, which is higher in anthroponyms than in lexical words in Mycenaean – a view
            that also holds for alphabetic Greek. </p>
        <p>
            <a name="n4"/>4. See Ch. de Lamberterie, ‘En hommage à Michel Lejeune : mycénien o-wo-we
            et le nom de l'« oreille » en grec’, in F. Biville-I. Boehm (eds.), Autour de Michel
            Lejeune, Lyon, 2009, p. 109-111. </p>
        <p>
            <a name="n5"/>5. Arbitrary precellence of verb over noun. The order of bilabels is not
            reversible, i.e. V Adj applies both to verbal adjectives and to verbal radicals provided
            with an adjectival suffix, see 8.1.2. </p>
        <p>
            <a name="n6"/>6. It is of note that the verbal adjective in -τος featuring in the second
            elements of compounds has inherited a passive value which has been retained on the
            whole, except when the analogy of the first element of the reverse compound comes into
            play, e.g., the analogy of Λύσ-ιππος ‘he who releases a horse’ might have changed the
            reverse compound Ἱππό-λυτος into its quasi synonym, see L. Dubois, in S. Hornblower-E.
            Matthews (ed.), Greek Personal Names. Their value as evidence, 2000, p. 48-51. In this
            particular case, -λυτος is labelled as V Adj, but the specific label YX&lt;XY (other
            examples in 8.2.2.1) points to the origin of its formation and the role of analogy is
            suggested by the words ‘see Λύσιππος’ in the ‘Onomastic references’ column. </p>
        <p>
            <a name="n7"/>7. See e.g. T. Lindner, ‘Komposition’, in T. Lindner (ed.) Indogermanische
            Grammatik, IV.1, Lieferung 1, Heidelberg, 2011, p. 24, n. 13a, and O. Tribulato, Ancient
            Greek Verb-Initial Compounds, Berlin- New York, 2015, p. 43-46. </p>
        <p>
            <a name="n8"/>8. For evidence of the use of -ιππος as a mere suffix with aristocratic
            connotation, in particular at Eretria, see L. Dubois, op. cit., p. 42-43, following
            Bechtel, Hermes 35 (1900), p. 326-331 (= KOS 1981, p. 98-103). </p>
        <p>
            <a name="n9"/>9. The trithematic name Theu-d-agoras/Θευ-δ-αγόρας either was intended to
            make sense and can lend itself to syntactic analysis: (ZYAbbrCX) ‘he whose speech is a
            god’s gift’ or resulted from mere juxtaposition of the dithematic compound Θεό-δοτος or
            Θεό-δωρος, abbreviated to Θεοδ-ῆς and another in -αγόρας, with no necessary semantic
            connection between the latter and the two elements of which the former is compounded. </p>
        <p>
            <a name="n10"/>10. However, the reverse structure Κύν-αργος, resulting from univerbation
            of hom. syntagm κύνες ἀργοί, dates back to the early history of Greek, on which see L.
            Dubois, loc. cit. </p>
        <p>
            <a name="n11"/>11. Pace J. L. García Ramón, op. cit., p. 220, who views Kall-aischros as
            a mere irrational compound, this name might well be a pun, as in Aristophanes, Knights
            1321: τὸν Δῆµον ἀφεψήσας ὑµῖν καλὸν ἐξ αἰσχροῦ πεποίηκα ‘I have freshened Demos up
            somewhat on the stove and have turned his ugliness into beauty.’ In the same vein, an
            adverb like δεινῶς ‘terribly’ can modify an adjective like µέλας by adding a quasi
            superlative touch to it. In the present case, the first element καλλ- might play a
            similar role and be likened to some oxymora of twentieth century French such as
            ‘vachement joli’ in which adjective vache means ‘nasty’, or to Engl. ‘terribly
            attractive’.</p>
