                The eight volumes of the Lexicon of Greek Personal Names (<b>LGPN</b>) that have appeared to date record all the
                persons known in Greece, mainland and islands, Asia Minor and up to the far reaches of the Greek-speaking
                world from the beginning of the alphabetical period down to late antiquity. A total of <b>350,000</b> individuals
                have been identified up to now, all together bearing <b>35,000</b> different names, a small proportion of which
                only are of non-Greek origin. In both print and online versions, the data provided for every bearer of the
                name include gender, place, date and source.

            <p>
                In this context, the purpose of our project <i>LGPN-Ling, Etymological and Semantic analysis of ancient
                Greek personal names: electronic and printed dictionary</i> is twofold:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    to provide its essential semantical complement to the LGPN Database, which is currently being
                    re-designed to permit such an extension<br/>
                    (see <a href="http://www.lgpn.ox.ac.uk/online/index.html">http://www.lgpn.ox.ac.uk/online/index.html</a>
                    and new <a href="http://clas-lgpn4.classics.ox.ac.uk:8080/exist/apps/lgpn/index.html">http://clas-lgpn4.classics.ox.ac.uk:8080/exist/apps/lgpn/index.html</a>).
                </li>
                <li>
                    to extract from it a printed dictionary, intended to replace the outdated work of Friedrich Bechtel
                    <i>Die Historischen Personennamen des griechischen bis zur Kaiserzeit</i> (1917, hereafter <b>HPN</b>).
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                The aim is to elucidate the meaning of Greek names, a task which has never before been undertaken except in
                sporadic fashion and without argument in the outdated work of W. Pape-G. E. Benseler, Wörterbuch der
                griechischen Eigennamen (1870; hereafter <b>PB</b>) and, for names known from papyri, in the Trismegistos database
                (<a href="http://www.trismegistos.org/nam/search.php">http://www.trismegistos.org/nam/search.php</a>).
                Justifications of proposed meanings will be given, drawn from
                the various sources available to us: literature, grammarians, epigraphy and papyri.

            <h3>a. Reformed alphabet of Ionic-Attic koine</h3>
            <div class="subchapter-indent">
                <p>
                    With a view to facilitate query using the database interface and in accordance with the spelling reform of
                    403 BC under archon Eucleides, we chose to systematically write — no matter the date of their attestation—
                    as η and ω the inherited vowels /e:/ and /o:/, and as ει and ου the so-called spurious diphthongs /e:/ et /o:/
                    resulting from contraction and compensatory lengthening, a script that was to become that of koine.
                    Whenever a name is a hapax while being attested in pre-Euclidean alphabet, in which E and O denoted the
                    long as well as the corresponding short vowels, or in dialects such as Boeotian or Thessalian, in which the
                    spelling of long vowels of the mid series deviates from this common norm, the original orthography will appear
                    in the form of the constituent theme (for the time being invisible albeit already edited, but intended to be
                    searchable and accessible by means of a drop-down menu).

            <h3>b. Hierarchization and selection criteria of genuine Greek and Greek hybrid names</h3>

            <div class="subchapter-indent">
                <h4>α) Lemma <i>vs</i> variant forms</h4>
                    <p>
                        Following Bechtel's <i>HPN</i> practice, we open <b>only one entry grouping all variant forms</b> of a name,
                        whether compound or simple. This entry, or lemma has been chosen arbitrarily as <b>the earliest attested form with the earliest attested gender</b>. However, whenever variant forms collected in diverse dialect areas are
                        exactly contemporaneous, the lemma chosen is either the form documented in the dialect bearing the remotest
                        resemblance to Attic or the form with the less frequently attested gender, viz. the feminine: rarity is then
                        the selection criterion.
                    </p>

                    <ul class="list-style-disc">
                        <li>
                            As a consequence, there is <b>only one entry</b> for pairs (or even triplets) of names differing from each other
                            by common grammatical gender endings, such as the following:
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    masc. in -ᾱ/ης or -ος <i>vs</i> fem. in -ᾱ/η, -ᾰ or -ον, e.g. Habragoras/Ἁβραγόρας <i>vs</i> Ηabragora/Ἁβραγόρα,
                                    Kallinikos/Καλλίνικος <i>vs</i> Kallinike/Καλλινίκη, Habryllos/Ἅβρυλλος <i>vs</i> Habrylla/Ἅβρυλλᾰ and Onesiphoros/Ὀνησίφορος
                                    <i>vs</i> Onesiphoron/Ὀνησίφορον, or even the triplet Anchios/Ἄγχιος <i>vs</i> Anchias/Ἀγχίας <i>vs</i> Anchia/Ἀγχία.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    fem. in -εια <i>vs</i> masc. in -ύς e.g. Hēdeia/Ἥδεια <i>vs</i> Hēdus/Ἥδυς or <i>vs</i> masc. in -ης, like Eugeneia/Εὐγένεια <i>vs</i> Eugenes/Εὐγένης;
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    fem. in -ίς <i>vs</i>. masc. in -ις, such as fem. AnaxisἈναξίς <i>vs</i> masc. Ἄναξις;
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    fem. participles in -ουσα <i>vs</i> masc. -ων, such as Areskousa/Ἀρέσκουσα <i>vs</i> Areskôn/Ἀρέσκων, and
                                    in -ασα <i>vs</i> masc. -ας, like Arkesasa/Ἀρκέσασα <i>vs</i> Arkesas/Ἀρκέσας;
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    em. in -ώ and -οῦς <i>vs</i> masc. in -ων and -οῦς, e.g. Agathô/Ἀγαθώ and Agathous/Ἀγαθοῦς <i>vs</i> Agathôn/Ἀγάθων
                                    (cf. Ἀριστώ, daughter of Ἀρίστων, at Milet, first century, and see L. Dubois, in <i>Onomatologos</i>, 402, 407 and 418);
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    compounds whose masc. second element is -άναξ <i>vs</i> fem. -άνασσα, e.g. Archianax/Ἀρχιάναξ <i>vs</i> Archianassa/Ἀρχιάνασσα.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Conversely</b>, the other forms are given as variants of the lemma. <b>A single dialect area is given for each variant</b>,
                            again that of the earliest attestation. If several variants appear to be exactly contemporaneous,
                            the dialect area containing a majority of these, or else the most peripheral area, will be elected,
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This principle applies in particular to <i>dialectal variants</i> of the roots or bases and suffixes, notably
                            to all <i>containing an /a:/</i>, recorded as α or η depending on dialect or historical period. Accordingly,
                            there is only one entry for Dēmonikos/ Δηµόνικος and Dāmonikos/Δᾱµόνικος.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It is the same with other types of phonetic/orthographic variants, such as Thess. Eupolos/Εὔπολος, fourth
                            century, subsequently Eukolos/Εὔκολος, second century, or Boeot. Agathoklidas/Ἀγαθοκλίδας, fifth cent. <i>vs</i> Dor.
                            Agathokleidas/Ἀγαθοκλείδας, Hell., or names whose spelling has been affected by postclassical iotacism <i>vs</i> those
                            retaining their etymological spelling. In all these cases, the entry is the earliest attested of the variants.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The same goes for compounds whose second element is -κλέᾱς &gt; -κλᾶς <i>vs</i> sigmatic -κλέης &lt; -κλῆς (&gt;-κλέης Χ -έᾱς,
                            see Buck, <i>Greek Dialects</i>, 1955, § 166.1), such as Hēracleas/Ἡρακλέας <i>vs</i> Hēraclas/Ἡρακλᾶς <i>vs</i> 
                            Hēracléês/Ἡρακλέης <i>vs</i> Hēraclês/Ἡρακλῆς.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Finally, the same holds for not necessary dialectal alternative forms, e.g. o/ᾱ, the paradigmatic vowel
                            of one of the elements of compounds such as Athenodōros/Ἀθηνό-δωρος (464x) <i>vs</i> Athenādōros/Ἀθηνά-δωρος
                            (1x: Thessaly, second cent.) or ο/ᾰ: these are the the two possible outcomes of the vocalization of a
                            sonant within a zero degree suffix or base, e.g. Stratonike/Στρατο-νίκη (261x) <i>vs</i> Strotonika/Στροτο-νίκα
                            (2x: Boeotia, third cent.)<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="subchapter-indent">
                <h4>β) Retained types of Greek hybrid names: mixed label Gr.-...</h4>

                <p>Only the following four categories of Greek hybrid names will be analysed:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Greek base + alien suffix: Gr.-Lat. Pant-auch-ianos/Παντ-αυχ-ιανός</li>
                    <li>Greek base + alien base or vice versa: Gr.-Thrac. Bendi-dōros/Βενδί-δωρος</li>
                    <li>
                        Double interpretation names, resulting either from homophony or from interlanguage assonance:
                        Gr. –Iran. Habro-komas/Ἁβρο-κόμᾱς, cf. Iran. *abra ‘rain, clouds’ and kāma ‘wish, will’
                        « Wolken-Wunsch » [Hinz]?, see R. Schmitt, <i>Die Iranischen und Iranier-Namen in den Schriften
                        Xenophons</i> 2002, p. 41, understood in Greek as ‘whose hair is splendid’).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Hellenized native names subsequently transmitted as Greek names:
                        the Greek anthroponym Abydo-komēs/Ἀβυδο-κόμης stems from Ἄβυδος in Troas, a hellenized Anatolian city.

                </ol>
                <p>
                    Has not been analysed the reverse of 1) = alien base + Greek suffix: see e.g. for the Thracian area,
                    Dan Dana, in <i>La suffixation des anthroponymes grecs antiques</i> (SAGA 2017), p. 201-223. Semantic calques
                    or interlinguistic synonyms have been left out for future studies.

            <h3>b. Translation</h3>
            <div class="subchapter-indent">
                <p>
                    Only occasionally have names been translated: most of the time we remain at the level of elements of
                    meaning, since the focus is on the name per se - viewed as an abstract entity - rather than on any of
                    its occurrences. In fact, in view of the extension in space and time of the scope  of its attestations,
                    a name is likely to have undergone notable variations in terms of meaning or connotation.
                    This is particularly true as the semantic value of their constitutive element(s) could vary from
                    one dialect to another. However, when the name is a paronym of a word of the lexicon or exactly
                    coincides with it, a <i>Logeion</i> link to the <i>LSJ</i> and <i>DGEsp</i> dictionaries gives access to the English and
                    Spanish translations, and sometimes a French translation is added (see 10).

        <div>
            <h3>d. Typology of compounds</h3>
            <div class="subchapter-indent">
                <p>
                    Given the overrepresentation of Hellenistic and Imperial material, the classification system adopted
                    for compounds has been mainly synchronic (headedness, XYZ labels) rather than resting on inherited
                    syntactic categories (possessives, hypostatics, verbal rection, determinatives)<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Systematic treatment of anthroponymic onomastics viewed as a lexicon personae is a all the more sensitive matter as this field has been even more creative than for the lexicon at large, especially regarding name compounding and derivation of abbreviated compounds and simplicia. Thus, the logical labelling of structures reshaped by analogical renovation within particular series of compounds has often to remain hypothetical. For instance, regarding compounds whose second element is a verbal adjective in –τος, some were probably coined on the analogy of a reverse structure having a first verbal element in –σι, such as Lysippos/Λύσ-ιππος <i>vs</i> Hippolytos/Ἱππό-λυτος, whence YX&lt;XY, see 8 and n. 5 below . The same holds true for names like archaic Aeol. Abanthis/Ἀβ-ανθίς (&lt;*αυσ-ανθ-, with οὖς ‛ear’ &lt;*aus and ἄνθος ‘flower’), YX(?) <i>vs</i> reverse Cret. Anthôtas/Ἀνθ-ώτας, XY/YX, which are all the more opaque for us as they remain isolated.

                <b>1*.</b> Lemma, transliterated in Latin alphabet, preceded where appropriate by GPR, a label indicating that there is a Latin form of the name listed in <i>Die griechischen Personennamen in Rom</i> by H. Solin (2003).<br/>
                <b>2*.</b> Lemma in Greek alphabet, spelt according to Foreword, a. It will later be <b>linked to its bearer(s)</b> in the LGPN database. Concerning the lemma and its variants, see above under Foreword, b, α.<br/>
                <b>3*.</b> Number of occurrences (automatically extracted from the LGPN database).<br/>
                <b>4*.</b> Gender: masculine, feminine or both (extracted).<br/>
                <b>5*.</b> Dialectal/areal and bilingual labels. Bilingual labels deal with the various types of hybrid names that we chose to treat: these hybrids reflect contacts between Greek and another language. Dialectal/areal labels relate to obviously dialectalized names (phonetics/morphology) and names that, albeit belonging to a given dialectal area, lack specific characteristics thereof or are attested when the dialectal period is over. Accordingly, in addition to dialectical labels in the strict sense we use broad geographical labels such as Asia minor, central Greece, Peloponnese, northern Thrace and northern coast of the Black Sea. These allow to substantially reduce the number of other labels. For instance, a name whose earliest attestation is in Arcadia while being also attested elsewhere in the Peloponnese might be simply labelled <i>Pelop.</i>, unless it displays typical Arcadian morphology, in which case the label would be: <i>Arcad.</i>, <i>Pelop</i>.
                    Up to three labels are employed to characterize each lemma, resulting into the following five labelings:
                    <ol class="list-style-lower-alpha sublist-indent">
                        <li>Label 1 = name attested in one dialect area;</li>

            <p>
                <span class="h5">7.1. Prefixes*</span>: adverbial elements such as negative α(ν)/ν-, copulative (h)α-, αµφ(ι), αν(α), αντ(ι)-, εὐ-<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup>.

                Each of these elements, most often borrowed from lexical morphemes and sometimes from non anthroponymic onomastics, is given in a <i>protopypic</i> form – in the most generic possible: e. g. αρχ(ε/ι)- and αρχ(ο/ᾱ)-. In contrast, Bechtel described these analytically in the form of constituents such as « Ἀρχε-, Ἀρχι-, Ἀρχο-, Ἀρχη-, -αρχος zu ἄρχω » (<i>HPN</i> 78). Each of the latter elements, or Constituents, is also edited and will be searchable. Segmentation by hyphens has been guided by word formation whenever possible, with a view to separate the Root in the strict sense from the derivational affixes and suffixes attached to it, viz. those very elements that change it into a Base. The Base in some cases is identical with the Constituent, as in αγαλ-ματ-ι(ο)-, cf. ἀγαλμάτιον ‘small statue’.<br/>
                At the initial or medial position of the base and at the junction between prefix, base and suffix:
                <ol class="sublist-indent list-style-lower-alpha">
                    <li>
                        brackets isolate optional phonemes/graphemes (vowels and consonants whose presence or absence varies depending on dialect or chronology). Brackets on both sides of a junction point to a vowel that may belong to the first or the second element depending on whether the perspective is diachronic or synchronic.<br/>
                        By way of example: Ἁβρῶναξ (&lt;*Ἁβρο-ϝάναξ), a synchronically non-clivable compound (<i>HPN</i> 7): (h)αβρ(ο)- + -(ϝ)ανακ(τ)-.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        a slash separates elements apt to alternate according to context (vowels alternating in height, sonants with their diverse vocalizations and consonants variously realized depending on dialect and period of time). Except where alternation is significant (αγορ[ᾱ]- <i>vs</i> ᾱγορ[ο]-, νῑκ[ᾱ/ο] and so forth), we omit to systematically display the ᾱ as a variable alternating with the thematic vowel in the frame of noun inflection. Consequently, a base with its thematic vowel may stand as default base. Last, vowel /a:/ whose sounding evolved into /ε:/ in Ionic-Attic and later koine and came to be written as η is simply noted ᾱ.<br/>

                    </li>
                </ol>
                By way of example: for Εὐφραῖος, zero-grade φρᾰ- (dat. pl. φρᾰσί, Pind.) of φρήν, φρενός, -φρων, plus suffix *-yo- implies that the name was diachronically segmented -φρα-ιος, whereas synchronically it might be considered as one of the many names in -αῖος. As a result, Εὐφραῖος is edited as ευ + φρ(ον/ᾰ) + (V)ιος.

                <span class="h5">7.3. Suffixes</span>
                Up to four suffixes (Φιλ-ων-ιχ-ίδ-ης<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup>) have been arranged from left to right in the tables, that is, in the reverse order of their frequency and importance: the suffix head (<b>Flect1</b>) of the suffixal chain – a morpheme all the more essential as it is flectional<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> - thus ranks 1. The other three are stricto sensu anthroponymic suffixes: they belong to the anthroponym proper rather than to the base of the lexeme underlying the anthroponym, as for instance, -ο-μεν(ο)- in ἀγαλ(λ)-ο-μεν(ο), which is the base of Ἀγαλλομένη since this name was built on participle ἀγαλλόμενος, -η, -ον.<br/>
                Regarding the Flectional Morpheme (<b>Flect1</b>), we chose by convention to privilege a synchronic, i.e. the speaker’s, point of view: for him the anthroponymic flectional suffix of a name like Θευδαγόρας is -ᾱς, notwithstanding the fact that this paradigmatic vowel may coincide with that of the derivational suffix constitutive of the base αγορ(ᾱ). For naming his progeny, the speaker may wish to alternate this suffix with e.g. -ίδ-ᾱς or with the corresponding fem. suffix -ᾱ, e.g. in fem. names in - αγόρᾱ. This cell is thus always filled, including for compounds whose second element is of the - ά/ήνωρ type. In these, -ωρ-, albeit etymologically belonging to the base, has been labelled as Flect1 as well. As expected, <b>Flect1</b> is most often the only one represented, either in its simplest form ― e.g. -ς, the nominative of names with second element -(ϝ)ανακ(τ)- ― or more broadly as a desinential complex like -αῖος. The list of the corresponding genitives in <i>La suffixation des anthroponymes grecs antiques</i> (<i>SAGA</i> 2017), p. 691-693, has been updated in the following table.

        <i>Labelling of abbreviated compounds and simplicia</i>. Suffixation, being notably
        developed in the case of such monothematic personal names, has led to endeavour – in this
        particular case only, this does not hold for compounds – to label the root's or base's
        function adding to it a suffixal categorization, to the extent that the latter is clearly
        identifiable. Thus, we have: <br/>

            Arch-agathos/Ἀρχ-άγαθος: the oldest pattern is the reverse compound
            Agath-archos/Ἀγάθ-αρχος ‘good leader’ (YX). Inverting the elements may have retained the
            former meaning or else made it evolve towards ‘he who commands good men’ (XY). Further
            on, the adverbalization of ἀρχ(ι), now endowed with a superlative sense close to ἀρι-,
            ἀγα- and so forth may have led to reinterpreting this name as ‘overgood’ (YX), see
            8.1.1. </div>
        <b>8.2.2.4.</b> So-called irrational secondary compounding (O. Masson, OGS 1, p. 88 [1966])
        involving seemingly functional and/or semantically incompatible radicals, to the point of
        blurring the read direction: XY/YX (default label) Irr*. Ex.: Lysainetē/Λυσ-αινέτη : the
        expected syntactic compounding XY (λυσ- ‘unlash, liberate’ remaining as a verbal head (X)
        ist incompatible with the second element (V Adj) ‘he about whom it is talked, praiseworthy‘
        in principle also occupying the head position, see HPN 26, unless it is conjectured that the
        name came to be reinterpreted as ‘the liberation about which it is spoken, that has had so
        much impact‘, the first element now being related to the action noun λύσις: in this guise it
        might represent a feminine derivative of the father’s nickname or of an ancestor who
        liberated the city. </p>
    <p>
        <b>9. Meanings of radicals or bases</b>
        <br/> As mentioned above under Overview, the name is difficult to translate if viewed as an
        abstract entity. As a consequence, we chose to suggest one to three meanings for each
        radical, these meanings corresponding on the whole to lemmata entered in the etymological
        dictionaries DELG and EDG, see 10. In principle, the three meanings have been arranged from
        the most generic down to the most specific. If the radical appears in the lexicon as verbal
        form(s) or noun(s) and have these same values in the anthroponym, the three meanings are
        intended to cover them all. Thus, αρχ ‘(be) first, leader, magistracy’; αγορ ‘(speak in)
        assembly, speech’ bring together the values of noun ἀγορά and denominative verb ἀγορεύω ;
        αιθ ‘light up, blaze, (colour of) fire’ gathers two verbal diatheses and two nominal
        meanings, the former more generic and the latter more specific. The brakets allow to collect
        two meanings under a single sense. </p>
    <p>
        <i>Structural and semantic analysis of 3 examples commented above</i>: <br/>
        <b>Abaio-krit-os/Ἀβαιό-κριτ-ος</b>, N Adj-V Adj (YX) ‘Abaios (Apollo) - choice, chosen’:
        Abai- is the radical of an epiclesis of Apollo, hence N Adj and the radical of the 2nd
        element is verbal adj. with passive sense, of verb κρίνω, hence V Adj. The latter is the
        head X of this syntagm, hence a YX structure. This reading sense favours the sense ‘chosen
        by/choice of (Apollo) Abaios’. <br/>
        <b>Ab-anthis/Ἀβ-ανθίς</b> N-N (XY/YX) ‘ear-flower, bloom, blooming’: in this case analysis
        may hesitate beween a recting nominal syntagm (YX ‘ear flower’ or ‘earring’) and a nominal
        predicate (ear flower or flower-shaped ear XY). The possibiltiy of double reading is summed
        up by XY/YX. <br/>
        <b>Archi-anax/Ἀρχι-άναξ</b>, VAdv-N (XY&gt;YX) ‘(be) first, leader, magistracy’-‘(be) lord,
        protect’: Archwas originally V and the second-element radical was N. Head X is expected to
        be the verb, hence XY, but Arch- may also have been employed as an Adv modifying N, hence
        XY&gt;YX and a shift of meanings from ‘leading lords’ to ‘arch-lord’. </p>

            examples in 8.2.2.1) points to the origin of its formation and the role of analogy is
            suggested by the words ‘see Λύσιππος’ in the ‘Onomastic references’ column. </p>

            <a name="n7"/>7. See e.g. T. Lindner, ‘Komposition’, in T. Lindner (ed.) Indogermanische
            Grammatik, IV.1, Lieferung 1, Heidelberg, 2011, p. 24, n. 13a, and O. Tribulato, Ancient
            Greek Verb-Initial Compounds, Berlin- New York, 2015, p. 43-46. </p>
        <p>
            <a name="n8"/>8. For evidence of the use of -ιππος as a mere suffix with aristocratic
            connotation, in particular at Eretria, see L. Dubois, op. cit., p. 42-43, following
            Bechtel, Hermes 35 (1900), p. 326-331 (= KOS 1981, p. 98-103). </p>
        <p>
            <a name="n9"/>9. The trithematic name Theu-d-agoras/Θευ-δ-αγόρας either was intended to
            make sense and can lend itself to syntactic analysis: (ZYAbbrCX) ‘he whose speech is a
            god’s gift’ or resulted from mere juxtaposition of the dithematic compound Θεό-δοτος or
            Θεό-δωρος, abbreviated to Θεοδ-ῆς and another in -αγόρας, with no necessary semantic
            connection between the latter and the two elements of which the former is compounded. </p>
        <p>
            <a name="n10"/>10. However, the reverse structure Κύν-αργος, resulting from univerbation
            of hom. syntagm κύνες ἀργοί, dates back to the early history of Greek, on which see L.
            Dubois, loc. cit. </p>
        <p>
            <a name="n11"/>11. Pace J. L. García Ramón, op. cit., p. 220, who views Kall-aischros as
            a mere irrational compound, this name might well be a pun, as in Aristophanes, Knights
            1321: τὸν Δῆµον ἀφεψήσας ὑµῖν καλὸν ἐξ αἰσχροῦ πεποίηκα ‘I have freshened Demos up
            somewhat on the stove and have turned his ugliness into beauty.’ In the same vein, an
            adverb like δεινῶς ‘terribly’ can modify an adjective like µέλας by adding a quasi
            superlative touch to it. In the present case, the first element καλλ- might play a
            similar role and be likened to some oxymora of twentieth century French such as
            ‘vachement joli’ in which adjective vache means ‘nasty’, or to Engl. ‘terribly
            attractive’.</p>
